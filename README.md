## Thief Kits

### Dart Thrower

Many a boisterous lout seeks out a tavern to rid themselves of their coin, but while the dart thrower looks the same on the surface, they have the opposite in mind: Be it honest winnings from a fair game, or the contents of spectators pockets snatched while they're watching the other competitors, the dart thrower's affable drunkenness lures them in, while their quick and steady hands seize the prize.

## Sorcerer Kits

### Virtuoso

Aloof and ostentatious even by sorcerer standards, the virtuoso focuses on exclusively on mastering a select few spells over gaining a large variety of talents. What spells they do choose to focus on, they cast with astonishing speed, precision and frequency. Anything that is not their chosen field of expertise, however, they are almost comically inept at, if they choose to make the attampt at all. Such lesser tasks, they reason, are best left to those of lesser skill.

- can cast 2 more spells per day per spell level than regular sorcerers
